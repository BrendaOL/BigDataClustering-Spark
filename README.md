# BigDataClustering-Spark
Big Data Processing, implementing a bisecting k-means analysis in Spark.
This project is a practical assignment to implement the bisecting k-means algorithm for cluster detection in Spark and use it on a large dataset of NYC taxi trips that include all of the pickup points of more than 173 million individual trips. The goal is to cluster all pickup points to determine the ideal starting positions for the taxis.

### _This assignment is part of Cloud Computing and BigData course (2022) at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, under the supervision of Prof. De Koster._

Bisecting k-means is a hierarchical variation of k-means clustering, therefore, the k-means
algorithm will be developed first. The Tools and libraries used are:
- Development environment: IntelliJ IDEA
- Scala Version: 2.12.5
- Spark: 3.0.1
- JDK: 1.8
